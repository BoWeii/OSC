# My OSC 2022
This course aims to introduce the design and implementation of operating system kernels. You’ll learn both concept and implementation from a series of labs.

This course uses Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (rpi3 for short) as the hardware platform. Students can get their hands dirty on a Real Machine instead of an emulator.
